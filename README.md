This list includes 100% all the projects from [DFINITY Showcase](https://dfinity.org/showcase/) but is a lot more than that. It tries to index all the known IC dApps, regardless of whether it's received grants from the DFINITY Foundation or already hard-launched (do they ever?). 

If you find an IC dApp is still missing from this page, please [send a PR to its Github repo](https://github.com/zire/awesome-IC) so that I can merge, or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/herbertyang), or [send me an email](mailto: herbert.yang@dfinity.org?subject=More dApp on Awesome IC). Suggestions on how to make this site more useful to the community are very welcome. Many thanks.
